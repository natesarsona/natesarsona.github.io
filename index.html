                <h4>well happy new year. let's kick things into gear</h4>
                <p>it's evident i've put this site off into my peripherals simply because
                     all of december is one long period that everyone collectively agrees to not put pressure on deadlines.</p>
                <p>not that i have any.</p>
                <p>upon the annual tradition of self-reflection (that usually only occurs for the first three weeks of the new year)
                    i've come to realize that I am blessed with the drive to maintain resourcefulness on the internet.</p>
                <p>i probably can't go into detail about <i>what</i> exactly i needed to scavenge from the depths of private forums and gated online communities,
                    however, i will say i am now fully equipped to learn industry standard practices in computer graphics and 3d modelling.</p>
                <p>also, i gifted myself a graphics tablet finally.. long overdue, right?</p>
                <p>anyways, time to go back to sculpting and then updating the portfolio. but here's my monthly check-in to whomever this site may concern</p>
                <p>thanks for making it this far. check out my uploads and send me a dm. my socials are accessible somewhere on here</p>

                <h4>i am primarily self taught through online resources</h4>
                <p>if not cautious, learning through tutorial can be a pitfall to creativity</p>
                <p>online tutorials breed inherently similar styles. individualism needs saving. </p>

                <h4>i can't stand pseudo-intellectual artist bios. i get why they exist, the ideal bio for me is this:</h4>
                <p>who am i?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>i went to art school at a school not known for art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt">re:<a></li>
                    <li>i like the internet, and the internet likes me.</li>
                    <li>in terms of computer software, i currently use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Blender</a> and 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeping_(communication)">■■■■■■■■■■■■■.</a> they are free and I like free stuff.
                        shoutout to the <a href="https://instagram.com/hawaii_freestore">UH Freestore.</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>i frame my thoughts through the context of a user in a MMORPG who gains identity, and authority,
                and fulfillment through completion of quests.</p>

    <h3>daily artist bio ramblings 11/16/22</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>generally, i frame my thoughts in the context of a MMORPG. a psychologist could totally explain why i do it, but a) that's not the main point and ii) personally i think it's because shrouding reality in a thin veil of delusion is equivalent to what front-end developers do when they overhaul a website's user-interface. </li>
        <li>think about what you do when you run into a website that has a shitty UI/UX.</li>
        <li>firstly, you simply don't run into websites like this because EVERY site has adopted the language of design. just as we have adopted the language of memes, shitposting, clout-chasing, and all those multi-prefixed-hyphenated ass words that no one can even define anymore because language moves at a speed that is out of my reading level (probably 5th grade at this point).</li>
        <li>secondly, if you were to run into a shitty website *cough-cough* --amazon-- <-- their website sucks. you just don't go through the trouble of whatever task you need to. shoutout dark patterns</li>
        <li>do not misunderstand me when i say that i frame my thoughts in the context of a MMORPG. I do not think everything is a simulation, that's boring and at this point almost reductionary to the beauty of carefully defined gameplay found in runescape, or OG maplestory, even dynasty warriors (you know the one with the cool red horse that goes really fast). <-- that gameplay was low key trash, but honestly the game was really fun.</li>    
    </ul>
